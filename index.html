                <p class="book-text">The American Nurses Association (ANA) Social Policy
                    Statement of 1980 was the first to define nursing as the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual and potential
                    health problems. This definition, when combined with the ANA
                    Standards of Practice , provided impetus and support for the use
                    of nursing diagnosis. Defi ning nursing and its effect on client
                    care supports the growing awareness that nursing care is a key
                    factor in client survival and in the maintenance, rehabilitative,
                    and preventive aspects of healthcare. Changes and new developments in healthcare delivery in the past 40 years have given
                    rise to the need for a common framework of communication to
                    ensure continuity of care for the client moving between multiple healthcare settings and providers. Evaluation and documentation of care are important parts of this process.

                <p class="book-text">The best-selling nursing drug guide for 41 years, Nursing Drug Handbook is meticulously
                    reviewed and updated annually by pharmacists and nurses to include the most current, relevant
                    information that practicing nurses and students need to know to administer medications safely in
                    any health care setting. As in previous editions, Nursing2021 Drug Handbook emphasizes
                    nursing and safety aspects of drug administration without attempting to replace detailed
                    pharmacology texts. Only the most essential information is included, and helpful graphic
                    symbols, logos, and highlighting draw special attention to critical details that can’t be
                    overlooked.
